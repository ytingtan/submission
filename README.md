What I did 
1. Routing 


2. State Management 
Decided on using redux since Header, ProductsList, ProductDetails and Cart needed to access the same data. 
I felt that i couldn't decide where the data should live, so I decided to just store it in redux. 
But redux is something new for me so I am learning it along the way and it is taking up quite a bit of time so maybe i should have stuck to passing props around...

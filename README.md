Concepts 
- Routing 
- CRUD 


Requirements: 
- A ​main page​ that show multiple products
- When product page is clicked, it will go to a separate product ​detail page​
- Product ​detail page​ will have add to cart
- When "​Add to cart button​" is clicked, it will update the cart icon to have number of the product in the cart
- A ​cart page​ will list the products which are added to the cart
- Cart page will calculate the total amount needed to be paid
- Cart will allow the change of quantity and removal of products
- Please use ReactJs for this assignment
- Please use https://fakestoreapi.com for retrieval of products

Bonus

- Write meaningful test cases only on cart page using jest and react-testing-library.
- Persist data of shopping cart even when browser is closed and reopen.
- Beautify the UI using tailwindcss framework
- Surprise Us :)

What I did 
1. Routing 
To get the NavBar working and pages connected. 

2. Designed Home page 
Basic design 
Potential improvments: add pictures? 

3. Products page 
3a. Layout 
Very standard grid format. Used dummy data at first. 
But 
3b. Call FakeStore API 
A lot of time trying to convert JSON Object into an array so I can map it to my display 

4. Product Details page
Was deciding between using a pop up or a page, eventually decided on Page.
But then how do i pass data to page :/
